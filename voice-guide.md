## Core Principles

### 1. **Clear Over Clever**

Always choose the clearest wording, even if it's more basic.

| ❌ Clever | ✅ Clear |
|----------|---------|
| "Leverage our sophisticated engagement intelligence" | "See who's most interested" |
| "Orchestrated workflow automation" | "Send follow-ups automatically" |
| "Actionable insights derived from behavioral patterns" | "Know when to follow up" |

### 2. **Specific Over Generic**

Replace vague claims with concrete numbers and examples.

| ❌ Generic | ✅ Specific |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Improve engagement" | "3x faster response rate" |
| "Better lead management" | "Find your hottest 10 leads in 30 seconds" |
| "Advanced analytics" | "See which messages get opened" |
| "AI-powered scoring" | "Automatically ranks leads by interest" |

### 3. **Customer Problem Over Product Feature**

Start with what matters to them, not what you built.

| ❌ Feature-First | ✅ Problem-First |
|----------------|-----------------|
| "Our CRM integrates with Gmail" | "Never miss a reply in email chaos" |
| "Multi-channel automation" | "Keep all conversations in one place" |
| "Real-time notifications" | "Get alerted when a hot lead replies" |
| "Lead scoring algorithm" | "Know who's ready to buy" |

### 4. **Action-Focused Over Passive**

Use active voice and action verbs.

| ❌ Passive | ✅ Active |
|-----------|----------|
| "Workflows can be created" | "Create workflows in seconds" |
| "Is integrated with Gmail" | "Connects directly to Gmail" |
| "Scoring is determined by AI" | "AI automatically scores leads" |

### 5. **Honest Over Hyped**

No superlatives, no promises you can't keep.

| ❌ Hype | ✅ Honest |
|--------|---------|
| "Revolutionary AI that transforms businesses" | "Automates your follow-up emails" |
| "The best CRM on the market" | "Built for service companies like yours" |
| "Guaranteed to 10x your revenue" | "Most customers respond 40% faster" |

---

## Writing Rules

### Sentence Structure

**Keep sentences short** (avg 12-15 words)

| ❌ Long | ✅ Short |
|--------|---------|
| "Through the use of advanced machine learning algorithms that analyze customer engagement patterns, our system can predict the optimal time to reach out to prospects, thereby maximizing conversion rates and improving overall business outcomes." | "AI finds the right time to follow up. Get 3x more responses." |

**Use periods, not commas**

| ❌ Comma Chain | ✅ Periods |
|---------------|----------|
| "Our system analyzes emails, identifies intent, scores leads, and notifies you of hot opportunities" | "Our system identifies hot leads. Scores them automatically. Alerts you instantly." |

**Active voice first**

| ❌ Passive | ✅ Active |
|-----------|----------|
| "Responses should be reviewed daily" | "Review responses every morning" |
| "It is recommended that follow-ups be automated" | "Automate follow-ups to save time" |

### Word Choices

**Use these words** (warm, direct):
- See, know, get, find, create, send, track, discover, explore
- Fast, easy, simple, clear, smart, powerful
- You, your, us, we, together

**Avoid these words** (jargon, corporate):
- Leverage, utilize, orchestrate, synergize, paradigm
- Solution, platform, ecosystem, vertical
- Actionable, scalable, agile, robust, seamless
- Innovation, transformation, disruption

**Numbers over vague claims**:
- ✅ "3x faster responses"
- ❌ "Much faster responses"
- ✅ "40% improvement in conversion"
- ❌ "Significant improvement in conversion"
- ✅ "Respond to 100 leads in 1 hour"
- ❌ "Handle massive volume easily"

### Punctuation

**Use contractions** (sounds friendlier):
- "We've automated" not "We have automated"
- "Don't worry" not "Do not worry"
- "You're covered" not "You are covered"

**Use em-dashes for emphasis** (better than commas):
- "Get alerts when leads reply—even at 2am"
- "Automate campaigns—save 5 hours per week"

**Use colons for lists** (clearer structure):
- "Three ways to find hot leads: check their email opens, see reply speed, view engagement score"
