# Phase 3: Transformation Designer Brief
## Australian Tradie Focus - Custom Illustrations & Brand Identity

**Project**: Unite-Hub UIUX Transformation (Phase 3)
**Client**: Unite-Hub (SaaS Marketing CRM)
**Timeline**: 3 weeks (Jan 6 - Jan 24, 2025)
**Budget**: $1,500-2,500 AUD
**Status**: READY TO POST

---

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### What We're Building
A distinctive visual brand identity for Unite-Hub, a marketing automation CRM targeting **Australian service business owners** (tradies, electricians, plumbers, builders aged 35-55).

**Goal**: Make the product feel less corporate and more approachable—like a tool designed specifically for Australian tradies, not a generic SaaS app.

### The Problem We're Solving
- Current design feels "Silicon Valley" (modern but generic)
- Target audience is skeptical of tech, wants simplicity
- Need to build trust through relatable, authentic visuals
- Australian tradies respond to practical, no-nonsense design

### Who Will Use This
Australian service business owners who spend most of their time on job sites, not in offices.
