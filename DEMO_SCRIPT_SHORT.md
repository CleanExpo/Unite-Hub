### 1. Dashboard - The "Wow" Moment (45 seconds)

**Navigate to**: `/dashboard/overview`

**Point to Hot Leads Panel**:
> "See these contacts with scores of 80+? Our AI analyzed their email engagement, sentiment, and intent to tell you *exactly* who to contact first. No more guessing. No more manual data entry.
>
> This lead has a score of 87 because they:
> - Opened 5 of your last 6 emails

> - Mentioned a pain point your product solves
>
> All detected automatically by our AI."

### 2. AI Content Generation (60 seconds)

**Navigate to**: `/dashboard/content`

**Click on a generated email**:

> Watch - I'll generate a new email right now. *[Wait 10 seconds]*
>
