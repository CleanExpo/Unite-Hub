# Plan 04-04: Landing Page & Auth Completion

**Phase**: 4 - CRM/App Pages (Final)
**Goal**: Complete remaining high-impact pages from 04-01 scope + auth pages
**Estimated violations**: ~91

## Context

Plans 04-02 and 04-03 were executed before 04-01. This plan completes Phase 4 by migrating:
- Main landing page (critical - 69 violations)
- Auth flow pages (22 violations)

## Scope

### Task 1: Main Landing Page (~69 violations)
| File | Violations | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `src/app/page.tsx` | 69 | **CRITICAL** - Main entry point |

### Task 2: Auth Pages (~22 violations)
| File | Violations | Priority |
|------|-----------|----------|
| `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` | 19 | High - Auth flow |
| `src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx` | 2 | High - Auth flow |
| `src/app/auth/await-approval/page.tsx` | 1 | Medium |
| `src/app/login/page.tsx` | 1 | High - Legacy auth |

## Token Mapping Reference

Standard mappings:
- `text-gray-900` → `text-text-primary`
- `text-gray-700` → `text-text-secondary`
- `text-gray-600/500/400` → `text-text-muted`
- `bg-white` → `bg-bg-card`
- `bg-gray-50/100` → `bg-bg-hover`
- `border-gray-200/300` → `border-border` / `border-border-subtle`
- `red-*` → `error-*`
- `green-*` → `success-*`
- `blue-*` → `info-*` (or preserve if decorative brand gradient)
- `yellow-*` → `warning-*`

**Preserve decorative**: Marketing gradients, brand CTAs (blue-to-emerald)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Task 1: `page.tsx` migrated (69 → 0 violations)
- [ ] Task 2: All auth pages migrated (22 → 0)
- [ ] Visual appearance preserved
- [ ] Phase 4 complete (~91 violations eliminated)
