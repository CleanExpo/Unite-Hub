## 3. Understanding AI Scores

### How Scoring Works

The AI analyzes each contact and assigns a 0-100 score:

| Score Range | Label | What It Means |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| 80-100 | **Hot** 🔥 | Ready to buy, prioritize immediately |
| 60-79 | **Warm** ☀️ | Interested, nurture carefully |
| 40-59 | **Cool** 🌤️ | Some interest, needs education |
| 0-39 | **Cold** ❄️ | Not ready, long-term nurture |

### Score Factors

| Factor | Weight | What AI Looks At |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Email Engagement | 40% | Opens, clicks, replies |
| Sentiment | 20% | Positive/negative tone in emails |
| Intent | 20% | Buying signals, urgency words |
| Job Title | 10% | Decision-maker level |
| Status | 10% | Pipeline progression |

### Using Scores Effectively

**Daily Routine:**
1. Start with Hot leads (80+)
2. Follow up Warm leads (60-79)
3. Batch process Cool leads
4. Auto-nurture Cold leads via campaigns
