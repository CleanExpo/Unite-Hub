# Phase 99: Autonomous Cross-Engine Harmonisation & Interaction Guard (ACEHIG)

## Overview

The Autonomous Cross-Engine Harmonisation & Interaction Guard (ACEHIG) prevents unintended side effects between engines by harmonising actions, predicting cross-engine conflicts, and blocking unsafe cascades.

## Features

- Cross-engine dependency mapping
- Cascade prevention
- Decision reconciliation
- Conflict prediction
- Safe rollback orchestration

## Conflict Types

- Resource contention
- Circular dependencies
- Timing conflicts
- Data consistency violations
- Capacity exhaustion cascades
