## Critical Issues

### 1. Phase Number Conflicts (40+ instances)
Almost every phase from 21-100 has two unrelated topics sharing the same number. This creates confusion about what each phase actually covers.

**Examples**:
- Phase 25: "Go Live" vs "Visual Intelligence Engine"
- Phase 47: "Project Prediction AI" vs "Client Launch Kit"
- Phase 72: "Industry Knowledge Graph" vs "First Client Guided Experience"

### 2. Missing Phase Numbers
- Phase 13, 14 not documented (gap after 12)
- No clear Phase 75-77 completion markers

### 3. Dual-Track Documentation
The project appears to have run two parallel development tracks:
- **Track A**: Client-facing features (launch kits, reports, UI)
- **Track B**: Backend engines (autonomous systems, AI engines)

These were numbered with the same phase numbers, causing conflicts.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (P1)
1. Create canonical phase list in `docs/PHASE_INDEX.md`
2. Rename conflicting files with suffix (e.g., `_TRACK_A`, `_TRACK_B`)
3. Mark deprecated/superseded docs clearly

### Short-term (P7)
1. Archive superseded phase docs
2. Create summary docs for each major phase range
3. Update CLAUDE.md with canonical phase references

### Long-term
1. Establish phase naming convention
2. Create phase completion checklist template
3. Implement doc versioning system
