## Objection Handling

### "We don't have the budget right now"
**Response**:
"I completely understand budget constraints. Let's break down the numbers:

If we generate just 2 extra projects per month at $30K each, that's $60K in revenue. With a 30% profit margin, that's $18K profit—covering the entire monthly investment of $6,500 with $11,500 to spare.

And that's conservative. Based on similar clients in construction services, we typically see 4-8 extra projects per month by month 6.

Would it make sense to start with Phase 1 only ($4,500/mo) to test results before committing to the full program?"

---

### "We're already working with a marketing agency"
**Response**:
"That's great to hear you're investing in marketing. Can I ask:
- How are you measuring ROI? (leads, revenue, projects won)
- Are they industry-specific or generalist?
- Do they integrate with your internal systems?

What we find is that many agencies focus on vanity metrics (followers, likes) rather than what matters for service businesses: qualified leads and project wins.

Our approach is different:
- We specialize in service-based businesses like yours
- Every campaign ties directly to revenue
- We integrate marketing with your operations (quotes, CRM, customer communication)

Would you be open to a 3-month trial to compare results side-by-side?"

---

### "We get enough leads from referrals"
**Response**:
"Referrals are fantastic—they convert at 3-4x higher than cold leads. But here's the challenge:

- Referrals are unpredictable (feast or famine)
- You're dependent on others' timelines
- Limited control over volume

What we're proposing isn't replacing referrals—it's adding a predictable lead engine that runs 24/7.

Imagine:
- Referrals: 10-15 projects/month (current)
- Digital leads: 5-10 projects/month (new)
- Total: 15-25 projects/month

Plus, when you show up #1 on Google, your referral partners are MORE likely to recommend you because you look established and professional.

Would doubling your project volume interest you?"

---

### "We've tried digital marketing before and it didn't work"
**Response**:
"I appreciate you sharing that. Many of our best clients said the same thing before working with us.

Can I ask what went wrong?
- (Listen to their response)

Here's what we do differently:
1. **Industry Expertise**: We work exclusively with service-based businesses, not retail or e-commerce
2. **Long-Term Strategy**: We optimize over 6-12 months, not expecting results in 30 days
3. **Integration**: We connect marketing to your operations (CRM, quotes, customer communication)
4. **Transparency**: Monthly reports with actual ROI, not just clicks and impressions

What if we guaranteed results? If we don't generate at least 20 qualified leads in the first 90 days, we'll refund 50% of your investment.

Would that address your concerns?"
