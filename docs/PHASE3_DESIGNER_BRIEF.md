## Project Overview

Unite-Hub is building a modern marketing platform specifically for Australian trade businesses (plumbers, electricians, HVAC, carpenters, etc.). We need **20 custom illustrations** that reflect the authentic Australian tradie experience.

**This is NOT corporate stock imagery.** We want friendly, modern, relatable visuals that tradies will see themselves in.

- Australian context (utes, hi-vis, local job sites)
- Diverse representation (gender, age, background)

**Technical:**
- SVG format (primary) OR PNG at 2000x2000px minimum
- Transparent backgrounds
- Optimized file sizes (<200KB per asset)
- Organized in layers (source files provided)

**Color Palette:**
