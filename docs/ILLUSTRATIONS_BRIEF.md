# Custom Illustrations Brief
**Project**: Unite-Hub Phase 3 Transformation
**Client**: Unite Group
**Timeline**: Weeks 7-9 (20 hours)
**Budget**: $1,500-2,500 AUD
**Status**: Designer Sourcing

---

## Project Overview

Unite-Hub is an AI-powered marketing automation platform for Australian trade businesses (electricians, plumbers, carpenters). We need custom illustrations that reflect our target audience: tradie business owners who need simple, relatable visuals that build trust.

**Key Message**: "We understand your business because we speak your language."

---

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Age**: 30-55 years old
- **Occupation**: Trade business owners (solo to 10-person teams)
- **Location**: Australian major cities (Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne)
- **Tech Savvy**: Low to medium
- **Values**: Practical, no-nonsense, Australian mateship culture

### Usage Context
- **Desktop**: Weekly planning sessions, detailed work
- **Mobile**: Quick checks at job sites, on-the-go approvals
- **Emotional State**: Busy, time-poor, skeptical of "fancy marketing"

---

## Visual Style Requirements

### Overall Aesthetic
- **Tone**: Friendly but professional, approachable but competent
- **Style**: Modern flat illustration with subtle depth (shadows, gradients)
- **Complexity**: Simple enough to read at 100x100px, detailed enough at 400x400px
- **Australian Context**: Utes (not trucks), hi-vis vests, job sites, Australian landmarks

### Must-Have Elements
1. **Australian Trade Context**
   - Utes (Toyota HiLux, Ford Ranger style)
   - Hi-vis safety vests (yellow/orange)
   - Power tools (drills, saws, spanners)
   - Job sites (scaffolding, work benches)

2. **Diversity & Inclusion**
   - Mix of genders (traditionally male-dominated, but changing)
   - Range of ages (young apprentices to experienced tradies)
   - Multicultural representation (reflect Australian diversity)

3. **Mobile-First**
   - Clear silhouettes (recognizable as icons)
   - Bold outlines (2-3px stroke)
   - High contrast (readable outdoors on mobile)

### Must-Avoid Elements
- Stereotypical "corporate" imagery (suits, ties, boardrooms)
- Overly feminine or cutesy styles (alienates core audience)
- American context (trucks instead of utes, hard hats instead of hi-vis)
- Cluttered backgrounds (keep focus on main subject)
