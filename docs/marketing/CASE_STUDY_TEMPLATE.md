- Manual tracking in spreadsheets prone to errors
- Inconsistent follow-up on quotes sent

---

## The Solution

BWR implemented Synthex Professional in October 2024. Within a week, their entire team was up and running.

### Implementation Timeline
| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Setup | 2 days | Data import, email connection |
