## Objection Handling Framework

3. **Explore** - Ask clarifying questions
4. **Respond** - Address with relevant solution

---

## Pricing Objections

### "It's too expensive"

**Acknowledge**: "I understand budget is a consideration. Let me show you the value you're getting."

**Response**:
- Compare to alternatives: "HubSpot with similar features costs $1,600+/month. Synthex Professional is $149."
- Focus on ROI: "Our customers typically see 47% improvement in conversion rates within 3 months."
- Show time savings: "Our AI saves an average of 10+ hours per week on lead qualification."

**Close**: "Would a 14-day free trial help you see the value before committing?"

---

### "I can get a cheaper CRM"

**Acknowledge**: "You're right, there are cheaper options out there."

**Response**:
- Differentiate: "Most cheap CRMs don't include AI lead scoring. You'd need to add that separately."
- Total cost: "When you add email marketing, automation, and AI tools, cheaper CRMs often cost more."
- Time cost: "Free/cheap tools often require more manual work. What's your time worth?"

**Close**: "Let me show you a side-by-side comparison of total costs including the features you need."

---

### "We don't have budget right now"

**Explore**: "When does your next budget cycle start?" / "What would make this a priority?"

**Response**:
- Start small: "Our Starter tier is $49/month - less than most coffee subscriptions."
- Monthly billing: "No annual commitment required. Cancel anytime."
- Cost of delay: "Every month without proper lead scoring, you're missing conversion opportunities."

**Close**: "Could we start with a pilot on the Starter plan and expand when budget allows?"

---

## Feature Objections

### "We already have a CRM"

**Explore**: "What CRM are you using? What do you like/dislike about it?"

**Response**:
- Integration: "Synthex can work alongside your existing CRM, or we can help migrate."
- AI difference: "Does your current CRM have AI-powered lead scoring? That's our core strength."
- Industry focus: "Most CRMs are generic. We're built specifically for restoration and trade services."

**Close**: "Would a demo showing what AI lead scoring could add to your workflow be helpful?"

---

### "We don't need AI features"

**Acknowledge**: "I hear that a lot from businesses who've never used AI for sales."

**Response**:
- Explain simply: "Our AI just tells you which leads are most likely to buy. It ranks them 0-100."
- Time savings: "Instead of manually reviewing every lead, focus on the hot ones first."
- Competitive edge: "Your competitors using AI will reach hot leads before you do."

**Close**: "Let me show you how it works with your actual data - no obligation."

---

### "Does it integrate with [X]?"

**Response (If we integrate)**:
"Yes, we integrate with [X] via [method]. Here's how it works..."

**Response (If we don't yet)**:
"We don't have a direct integration yet, but you can:
1. Use Zapier to connect them
2. Use our API for custom integration
3. Request it - we prioritize based on customer demand"

**Close**: "Would Zapier work for your use case? We can walk you through setting it up."

---

### "Your competitor has [feature]"

**Acknowledge**: "Good point. [Competitor] does offer that."

**Response**:
- Redirect to strengths: "What we focus on is AI lead scoring - our core differentiator."
- Future roadmap: "That feature is on our roadmap for Q2."
- Trade-offs: "They have [feature], but they lack [our advantage]. Which matters more to you?"

**Close**: "Based on what you've told me about your priorities, our AI scoring seems like a bigger win. Would you agree?"

---

## Trust Objections

### "I've never heard of you"

**Acknowledge**: "That's fair - we're newer to the market."

**Response**:
- Backing: "We're built on enterprise-grade technology from Anthropic (makers of Claude AI)."
- Customers: "We already serve restoration businesses across Queensland."
- Risk reversal: "Try free for 14 days. If it doesn't work, you've lost nothing."

**Close**: "Would customer testimonials or a reference call help build confidence?"

---

### "How do I know my data is secure?"

**Response**:
- Technical: "We use AES-256 encryption, SOC 2 practices, and Australian data centers."
- Compliance: "We're fully compliant with the Australian Privacy Act."
- Policies: "Row-level security ensures your data is completely isolated."
- Control: "You can export and delete your data anytime."

**Close**: "Would you like to see our security documentation?"

---

### "What if you go out of business?"

**Response**:
- Stability: "We're backed by [funding/parent company if applicable]."
- Data portability: "Your data is always exportable. You're never locked in."
- Standards: "We use standard formats - you can migrate to any CRM if needed."

**Close**: "We're committed for the long term, but your data is always yours."

---

## Timing Objections

### "We're too busy right now"

**Explore**: "What would need to change for this to be the right time?"

**Response**:
- Low effort: "Setup takes under an hour. We handle the heavy lifting."
- Time savings: "The busier you are, the more you need automation."
- Opportunity cost: "Every day without proper lead management costs you sales."

**Close**: "Could we schedule a 30-minute setup call for next week?"

---

### "Let me think about it"

**Explore**: "Absolutely. What specific aspects do you want to think through?"

**Response**:
- Identify hesitation: Address whatever they mention
- Create urgency: "Our early adopter pricing ends [date]."
- Follow-up: "Can I check back in on [day]?"

**Close**: "Would it help if I sent you a summary of what we discussed?"

---

### "We're in a contract with our current provider"

**Explore**: "When does your contract end?"

**Response**:
- Timeline: "Let's schedule a demo closer to your renewal date."
- Comparison: "In the meantime, would a feature comparison help with your evaluation?"
- Early exit: "Some providers let you exit early. Have you checked?"

**Close**: "Can I add a reminder to reach out 60 days before your renewal?"

---

## Decision Process Objections

### "I need to talk to my partner/boss"

**Acknowledge**: "Of course, this is a team decision."

**Response**:
- Prepare them: "What questions do you think they'll have? I can help you address them."
- Offer support: "Would it help if I joined a call with your team?"
- Materials: "Can I send you a summary you can share with them?"

**Close**: "When's a good time for us to reconnect after you've discussed?"

---

### "We need to evaluate other options"

**Acknowledge**: "Due diligence is smart. Who else are you looking at?"

**Response**:
- Differentiate: Share relevant comparison points
- Offer help: "I can provide an objective comparison if helpful."
- Stay top of mind: "Can I check in after you've done your research?"

**Close**: "What criteria are most important in your evaluation?"

---

### "Send me more information"

**Explore**: "Happy to! What specific information would be most useful?"

**Response**:
- Qualify: Is this genuine interest or a brush-off?
- Personalize: Send targeted materials, not generic brochures
- Follow up: "I'll send that over. Can we schedule a quick call to discuss?"

**Close**: "When would be a good time to walk through it together?"

---

## Industry-Specific Objections

### "Restoration businesses are different"

**Acknowledge**: "You're absolutely right - that's why we built Synthex specifically for your industry."

**Response**:
- Industry features: "We have templates for insurance claims, emergency response, and commercial bids."
- Understanding: "We understand the seasonal nature, insurance relationships, and emergency calls."
- Customers: "We serve restoration businesses just like yours."

**Close**: "Would you like to see how similar businesses use Synthex?"

---

### "My leads come from insurance companies, not marketing"

**Response**:
- Expand: "Insurance referrals are great. We help you maximize those relationships."
- Supplement: "What about commercial clients? Building managers? Property managers?"
- Nurture: "For the leads you do get, AI scoring helps you prioritize the best ones."

**Close**: "Even with referrals, knowing which ones are hottest helps you respond faster."

---

## Closing Techniques

### Trial Close
"Based on what we've discussed, does Synthex seem like a good fit for your needs?"

### Summary Close
"So you're looking for [need 1], [need 2], and [need 3]. Synthex addresses all of these. Ready to get started?"

### Now or Never
"Our launch pricing of $149/month is only available until [date]. After that, it goes to $199."

### Assumptive Close
"Let's get you set up on the Professional plan. Do you prefer monthly or annual billing?"

### Question Close
"What would you need to see to feel confident moving forward today?"

---

## Handling "No"

### If No Is Final
- Thank them for their time
- Ask for feedback: "What was the main reason?"
- Keep the door open: "If things change, I'm here."
- Ask for referral: "Know anyone else who might benefit?"

### If No Is Soft
- Identify real objection
- Address and re-close
- Offer alternative (different tier, longer trial)
- Schedule follow-up
