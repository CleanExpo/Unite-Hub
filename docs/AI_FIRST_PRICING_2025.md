## 📞 Objection Handling

### "That's still expensive for my small business"

**Response**:
> "I understand - let me put this in perspective. Traditional agencies charge $4,500-9,500/month. If you tried to do this yourself, you'd spend 20-30 hours/week (that's $2,000-4,000 in your time value). Our $495/month Starter plan costs $16.50/day - less than lunch - and we handle everything. Plus, with our 3-day money-back guarantee, you risk nothing to try it."

### "I don't know if AI can match human creativity"

**Response**:
> "Great question! Our AI doesn't replace human creativity - it amplifies it. We train it on YOUR brand voice, YOUR industry, YOUR customers. It's like having a marketing team that never sleeps, never gets tired, and learns from every post. And you approve everything before it goes live. Think of it as a smart assistant, not a replacement."

### "I need to think about it"

**Response**:
> "Absolutely - this is an important decision. Here's what I suggest: we have a 3-day money-back guarantee. Sign up today, and if after 3 days you don't think this is right for you, we refund 100%. No questions asked. That way you can actually SEE the platform, test it with your business, and make an informed decision. Sound fair?"

### "I'm already doing my own social media"

**Response**:
> "That's great - you're ahead of most businesses! Question: how many hours/week does that take you? [Wait for answer] And how much is your time worth per hour? [Calculate] So you're spending $X/month in time value. Our Starter plan at $495/month not only saves you those hours, but also brings AI-powered optimization, SEO, competitor analysis, and performance tracking you can't do manually. Plus you get those hours back to focus on what you do best - running your business."
