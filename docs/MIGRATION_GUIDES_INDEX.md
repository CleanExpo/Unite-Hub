## 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

### "I'm getting an error running migrations..."

```
Is the error "trigger already exists"?
  → YES: Read MIGRATION_ALREADY_APPLIED.md
  → NO: Continue below

Is the error "relation does not exist"?
  → YES: Read MIGRATION_ERRORS_CLARIFICATION.md
  → NO: Continue below

Is the error something else?
  → Read MIGRATION_DEPENDENCY_GUIDE.md (Troubleshooting section)
```

---

### "I want to apply migrations..."

```
This is my first time applying migrations?
  → YES: Read MIGRATION_DEPENDENCY_GUIDE.md

I want complete details about each migration?
  → YES: Read MIGRATIONS_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md

I want to know what was built?
  → YES: Read PHASE5_WEEK3_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md

I want to understand all 3 weeks of Phase 5?
  → YES: Read PHASE5_WEEKS1-3_SUMMARY.md
```

---

### "I need to verify my migrations..."

```
Check if migrations are already applied:

1. Use the SQL script from:
   - MIGRATION_DEPENDENCY_GUIDE.md (Verification Script section)
   - MIGRATION_ALREADY_APPLIED.md (Complete Migration Status Script)

2. See which tables exist:
   - managed_service_projects (270)
   - convex_custom_frameworks (242)
   - managed_service_strategies (272)
   - convex_framework_alert_rules (273)
   - convex_alert_analytics (274)

3. If all exist:
   → ✅ All migrations are applied
   → ✅ Nothing more to do
   → Read MIGRATION_ALREADY_APPLIED.md for verification

4. If some are missing:
   → Apply missing ones in order
   → Use MIGRATION_DEPENDENCY_GUIDE.md for order
```

## 🔄 The Migration Flow

```
1. Start with MIGRATION_DEPENDENCY_GUIDE.md
   ↓
2. Understand dependencies and order
   ↓
3. Run verification scripts
   ↓
4. Check status: Are migrations applied?
   ↓
   ├─ YES: Read MIGRATION_ALREADY_APPLIED.md
   │       ✅ You're done!
   │
   └─ NO: Apply migrations in order
          1. Read MIGRATIONS_COMPLETE_REFERENCE.md (details)
          2. Apply: 270 → 242 → 272 → 273 → 274
          3. Run verification scripts
          4. Confirm all tables exist
          5. ✅ You're done!
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After applying migrations, verify using MIGRATION_ALREADY_APPLIED.md:

- [ ] All 5 tables exist
- [ ] All RLS policies are in place
- [ ] All triggers are created
- [ ] All foreign keys are defined
- [ ] All indexes are created

**Quick check SQL** (from MIGRATION_ALREADY_APPLIED.md):

```sql
SELECT count(*) as tables_found
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name IN (
  'managed_service_projects',
  'managed_service_strategies',
  'convex_custom_frameworks',
  'convex_framework_alert_rules',
  'convex_alert_analytics'
);

-- Expected: tables_found = 5
```

- [ ] No manual intervention needed

### If Applying Manually

- [ ] Follow MIGRATION_DEPENDENCY_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Apply in order: 270 → 242 → 272 → 273 → 274
- [ ] Run verification scripts after each migration
- [ ] Check MIGRATION_ALREADY_APPLIED.md to confirm completion
