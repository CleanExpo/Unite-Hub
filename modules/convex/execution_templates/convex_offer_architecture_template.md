```

### 2.2 Price Point Testing

```
[PRICE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS - Find optimal price]

Test 1: $49/month
- Conversion: 8-12%
- Revenue per customer: $49
- LTV at 12-month: $588

Test 2: $99/month
- Conversion: 4-6% (50% drop expected)
- Revenue per customer: $99
- LTV at 12-month: $1,188

Test 3: $149/month
- Conversion: 2-4% (more drop)
- Revenue per customer: $149
- LTV at 12-month: $1,788

[OPTIMIZATION LOGIC]
- Lower price: More customers, lower LTV
- Higher price: Fewer customers, higher LTV per customer
- Find sweet spot: Maximize total revenue (conversions × price)

Example:
1000 visitors per month
- At $49: 10% convert = 100 customers × $49 = $4,900/mo
- At $99: 6% convert = 60 customers × $99 = $5,940/mo
- At $149: 3% convert = 30 customers × $149 = $4,470/mo
Winner: $99/month

[PRICING PSYCHOLOGY]
- Prices ending in 9 (99, 199, 499) convert 15-25% better than round numbers
- Bundle discounts (3-month at 10% off) increase LTV 20-30%
- Annual pricing (save 20%) increases commitment
- Free tier filters out low-intent (good thing)
```

## Phase 5: Objection Handling in Offer

### 5.1 Pricing Objection

```
[OBJECTION: "Your pricing is too high"]

Reframe with Value Translation:
Prospect: "Your pricing is expensive at $99/month"

Response Framework:
"Let's look at your ROI. You currently waste 10 hours/week prospecting (at $50/hour = $500/week or $26,000/year).
If we save you just 5 of those hours at a 25% increase in qualified leads:
- Time savings: $13,000/year
- Productivity increase: $50,000/year (from 35% more deals closed)
- Total value: $63,000/year
- Your cost: $1,188/year
- ROI: 5,200%"

Results Objection Overcome: Pricing now looks cheap

[STRUCTURE]:
1. Identify customer's biggest pain (10 hours wasted)
2. Quantify annual cost ($26,000)
3. Show your solution impact (5 hours saved + 25% leads)
4. Calculate total value ($63,000)
5. Compare to price ($1,188)
6. Show ROI (5,200%)
7. Frame: "This isn't a cost, it's an investment with 52x return"
```

### 5.2 Results Objection

```
[OBJECTION: "Will it actually work for us?"]

Handle with Specific Proof:
Prospect: "Will this really increase our qualified leads?"

Response with Case Studies:
"We work with companies just like you:
- [Customer Name] increased qualified leads 40% in 90 days
- [Customer Name] reduced prospecting time 60%
- [Customer Name] increased conversion rate 35%
- Average result across customer base: 35% lead quality increase"

Proof Options:
✓ Case studies (specific company, specific results, specific timeline)
✓ Testimonial video (customer on camera)
✓ Before/after data (show actual metrics)
✓ Trial period (let them test)
✓ Pilot program (limited scope, lower risk)

[HANDLE]: "We guarantee it. If you don't see 25% improvement in 90 days, we extend your subscription 3 months free."
Moves objection from "will it work?" to "let me try it"
```

### 5.3 Experience Objection

```
[OBJECTION: "Your team won't actually use it"]

Handle with Adoption Focus:
Prospect: "We've tried tools before and the team doesn't use them"

Response:
"That's because most tools are complicated. Here's what we do differently:
1. Onboarding: Personal setup call (not YouTube videos)
2. Habit Formation: Weekly 30-min coaching first month
3. Integration: Gmail integration (already where they work)
4. Support: Slack access to support team
5. Success: Quarterly business reviews to show ROI

95% of customers report their team actively uses our platform."

Proof:
- 95% adoption rate (vs. industry average 40%)
- Average 5 hours/week per user (shows real engagement)
- Testimonial from team member (not just manager)
