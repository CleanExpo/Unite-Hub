## Phase 1: Audience Definition Using CONVEX Buyer Psychology

### 1.1 Primary Audience Profile

```
[IDEAL CUSTOMER PROFILE - Deep psychographic research]

Demographics:
- Job Title: [___]
- Industry: [___]
- Company Size: [___]
- Decision-Making Authority: [___]

Psychographics (from CONVEX framework):
- Decision-Making Style:
  □ Conservative (risk-averse, needs proof)
  □ Progressive (early adopter, wants innovation)
  → Action: Adjust messaging based on style

- Pain Priority:
  □ Urgent (solve now)
  □ Development (solve month-long journey)
  → Action: Match urgency in ad copy

- Budget Authority:
  □ Self-funded (price-sensitive, ROI-focused)
  □ Enterprise (capability-focused, less price-sensitive)
  → Action: Emphasize ROI if self-funded, capability if enterprise

[BUYER PSYCHOLOGY TRIGGERS - CONVEX framework]
1. Certainty: "Guaranteed results" vs "Maybe results"
   → Use specific numbers, guarantees, proven results

2. Control: "We handle everything" vs "You have full control"
   → Emphasize customer control, customization, simplicity

3. Progress: "See results quickly" vs "Long-term investment"
   → Use progress metrics, milestone tracking, quick wins

4. Belonging: "Join our community" vs "Solo tool"
   → Emphasize community, social proof, shared values

[AUDIENCE SEGMENTATION]
Segment A: High-Intent (Ready to buy)
- Searching for solution category
- Actively comparing options
- Budget allocated

Segment B: Problem-Aware (Investigating)
- Aware they have problem
- Researching solutions
- Not ready to decide

Segment C: Unaware (Opportunity)
- Doesn't know problem exists
- High lifetime value if acquired
- Requires education
```

- Solution: Narrow targeting, increase relevance

Target range: 500k - 3M people per segment
```

## Phase 2: Ad Copy Variations (3+ Approaches)

### 2.1 Copy Testing Framework

```
[AD COPY TESTING - 3 Different Approaches]

Approach 1: BENEFIT-FOCUSED (Outcome-Oriented)
Headlines:
- "[Outcome] in [timeframe]"
  "Close 35% More Deals in 90 Days"
- "Stop [Pain Point]"
  "Stop Wasting 10 Hours/Week on Prospecting"
- "[Benefit] Without [Friction]"
  "Increase Sales Without Extra Hours"

Subheadings:
- Specific outcome with social proof
- "95% of customers see results within 90 days"

Body Copy:
- Focus on customer outcome
- Use numbers (35%, 90 days, 10 hours)
- Remove marketing jargon
- End with clear CTA

Example Full Ad:
Headline: "Close 35% More Deals in 90 Days"
Subheading: "AI automatically qualifies your best leads"
Body: "Stop wasting time on unqualified prospects. Our AI analyzes 500+ signals to show you your hottest opportunities first. 95% of customers see results within 90 days."
CTA: "See Your Results Free"

[COPY PERFORMANCE TARGETS]
- Click-through rate (CTR): 2-5% (baseline 1%)
- Quality score: 8+ (Google Ads)
- Expected improvement: +50-100% CTR vs. competitor average

Approach 2: PROBLEM-FOCUSED (Curiosity-Driven)
Headlines:
- "Why [Expected Belief] is Wrong"
  "Why Lead Lists Don't Close Deals"
- "[Percentage] of [Audience] Make This Mistake"
  "87% of Sales Teams Waste Time on Dead Leads"
- "The [Adjective] Truth About [Topic]"
  "The Uncomfortable Truth About Lead Scoring"

Body Copy:
- Acknowledge pain point
- Show emotional cost
- Hint at solution
- Curiosity loop (resolve on landing page)

Example Full Ad:
Headline: "Why Lead Lists Don't Close Deals"
Subheading: "Here's what sales teams are actually buying"
Body: "You buy lead lists, but 90% of leads are unqualified. They waste 10 hours/week. We show you the 10% that close deals. Click to see how."
CTA: "Discover How"

[COPY PERFORMANCE TARGETS]
- CTR: 2-4% (curiosity can underperform benefit if not resolved)
- Quality score: 7+
- Use when: Established brand, audience already trusts

Approach 3: EXCLUSIVITY-FOCUSED (Scarcity-Driven)
Headlines:
- "Join [Number] [Audience Type]"
  "Join 50,000 Sales Leaders Using Our AI"
- "[Feature] Only For [Specific Group]"
  "AI Lead Scoring: Only for Top Performers"
- "[Limited Offer] Expires [Date]"
  "90% Off + Free Training (Limited Time)"

Body Copy:
- Use social proof (customer count, authority)
- Create urgency (limited spots, time-limited)
- Emphasize exclusivity
- Fear of missing out (FOMO)

Example Full Ad:
Headline: "Join 50,000 Sales Leaders"
Subheadline: "Getting 35% more deals with AI lead qualification"
Body: "Top sales teams use AI to focus on leads that close. Join 50,000+ professionals. 75% off launch pricing available today only."
CTA: "Claim Your Spot"

[COPY PERFORMANCE TARGETS]
- CTR: 1.5-3% (scarcity works if genuine, fails if fake)
- Quality score: 6-8 (may underperform benefit approach)
- Use when: Genuine scarcity, limited supply
- WARNING: Fake scarcity kills trust and conversion
```

### 2.2 Copy Elements - Mandatory Inclusions

```
[REQUIRED ELEMENTS - Every ad must have]

1. Headline: Clear, benefit-focused, includes pain point or outcome
   Length: 30 characters (Google prefers short)

2. Subheadline: Clarifies benefit, builds credibility
   Elements: Social proof OR specific metric OR safety signal

3. Body Copy: Outcome-focused, removes objections
   Structure: Problem → Solution → Outcome

4. Call-to-Action: Action verb + benefit
   Examples:
   ✓ "See Results Free"
   ✓ "Start 7-Day Trial"
   ✓ "Claim Your Spot"
   ✗ "Click Here"
   ✗ "Learn More"

5. Landing Page Link: Must match ad messaging
   Rule: Headline in ad should match headline on landing page
```

## Phase 3: Visual Direction

### 3.1 Image/Video Requirements

```
[AD CREATIVE GUIDELINES]

Photography Style:
- Real customers (not stock photos)
- Showing actual product use
- Diverse, authentic representation
- Emotional expression (happiness, relief, confidence)

Visual Hierarchy:
- Main image/video 80% of ad space
- Text overlay maximum 20%
- High contrast between text and background
- Clear focal point (customer face or product)

Image Optimization:
- File size: <200KB (fast loading)
- Aspect ratio: Platform-specific (1.91:1 for Facebook, 1:1 for Instagram)

- Testimonial format (authentic, not scripted)

Color Psychology (CONVEX Brand Design):
- High-confidence colors: Blues (trust), Greens (growth)
- Avoid: Red (urgency fatigue), Orange (low conversion for B2B)
- Test: Control color + 2 alternates

[CREATIVE TESTING MATRIX]
Test Dimension 1: Photo vs. Video
- Photo: Fast loading, good for carousel ads
- Video: Higher engagement, better for story-telling

Test Dimension 2: Product vs. Customer
- Product: Show tool clearly

Test Dimension 3: Emotional vs. Rational

```
[LANDING PAGE CONSISTENCY]

Ad Creative:
- Headline: "Close 35% More Deals in 90 Days"

Landing Page Must Have:
- Same/similar headline (verbatim ideal)

Scaling Actions:
