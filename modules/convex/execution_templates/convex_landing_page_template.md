[SUBHEADLINE - Clarify and De-Risk]
"For [specific audience segment] who [specific situation] so they can [specific outcome]"

Copywriting Cues:

[LEAD IMAGE / VIDEO - Visual Proof]
Requirements:
- Shows transformation (before/after ideal)
- Not stock photo (real customer or product screenshot)
- Demonstrates outcome visually

[PRIMARY CTA - Action + Benefit]
"[Action Verb] + [Primary Benefit]"

- Copywriting: Use benefit language, not feature language

Design Direction:
- Color: High contrast (primary brand color)
- Size: Large button (40-50px height minimum)

- Hover: Clear hover state
- Accessibility: Clear focus state
```

**Measurable Targets**:

### 3. Problem Acknowledgment (Section 3)

**Purpose**: Show deep understanding of customer's situation

```
[PROBLEM STATEMENT - Acknowledge Real Pain]
"Most [industry] teams struggle with [problem]. You:"

Copywriting Cues:
- Start with customer's words (use interview quotes)
- Make relatable (customer sees themselves)
- Acknowledge emotional impact (frustration, lost opportunity)
- Show empathy (we get it)

Examples:
- "You spend 15 hours/week on manual prospecting that closes nothing"
- "Your team generates leads but can't qualify them fast enough"
- "You have great products but no systematic way to match them to customers"

[PAIN POINTS LIST - 4-5 specific pains]
- "❌ Waste time on low-value prospecting"
- "❌ Miss high-intent opportunities because you don't see them"
- "❌ Can't prioritize with confidence"
- "❌ Team doesn't trust the qualification process"

Design Direction:
- Use red/orange X for problems

```

**Measurable Targets**:

### 4. Solution Positioning (Section 4)

**Purpose**: Introduce solution as gap-closer for problems above

**Components**:
```
[POSITIONING STATEMENT]
"[Your Solution] transforms [Problem] into [Outcome]"

Copywriting Cues:
- Keep it simple (one sentence main claim)
- Make it ownable (competitors can't claim same)
- Use outcome language (not feature language)
- Create contrast with problem above

Example:
- Problem: "Waste time on low-value prospecting"
- Solution: "Auto-identify and prioritize your hottest leads"
- Outcome: "Focus on closing, not hunting"

[HOW IT WORKS - 3-Step Overview]
Step 1: [First customer action] → [Immediate result]
Step 2: [System action] → [Transparency into what happens]
Step 3: [You benefit] → [Customer outcome]

Example:
Step 1: "Connect your email" → "We instantly analyze your patterns"
Step 2: "AI qualifies leads" → "Shows you high-intent signals"
Step 3: "Close more deals" → "Save 10 hours/week of prospecting"

Design Direction:
- Number each step clearly (1, 2, 3)
- Use icons/illustrations for each step
- Keep step explanations to 2 sentences max
- Show process as progress (arrow between steps)

[FEATURES → OUTCOME TRANSLATION]
For each feature, show customer benefit:

Feature: "AI-powered lead scoring"
→ Benefit: "Automatically identify your best opportunities"
→ Outcome: "Close deals faster, hit quota without extra hours"

Feature: "Email integration"
→ Benefit: "See all communication in one place"
→ Outcome: "Never miss context on a lead"

Copywriting: Always show outcome, features just support proof
```

**Measurable Targets**:

### 5. Feature-to-Outcome Translation (Section 5)

**Purpose**: Demonstrate capabilities through outcome lens

[FEATURE NAME & Icon]
"The one thing that [specific outcome]"

How it works (1-2 sentences, outcome-focused)

[PROOF/EVIDENCE]
Case study snippet or metric proving feature delivers outcome

Example:

║  "Went from qualifying 10 leads/week to    ║
║  50, with 40% conversion rate" - Sales VP  ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝

[FEATURE LAYOUT OPTIONS]
✓ 3 Column Grid (6 features max)

Objection Format 2: Risk Reversal
"We're confident you'll see results."
- 30-day money-back guarantee
- No credit card to start trial
- Pause or cancel anytime
- Free implementation support

[TOP 5 OBJECTIONS TO ADDRESS]
Based on CONVEX competitor analysis:
1. "Is it right for our business?" → Address with customer profile match
2. "Will it actually work?" → Address with case studies/metrics
3. "Am I paying too much?" → Address with ROI calculation
4. "What if support sucks?" → Address with guarantee/testimonial
5. "Will team actually use it?" → Address with adoption rate/training

[COPYWRITING FOR OBJECTIONS]
✓ Good: "Designed for sales teams with 10-100 people"
  (Specific fit signals)

✗ Bad: "Works for all kinds of teams"
  (Too vague, doesn't overcome concern)

✓ Good: "30-day guarantee: If leads don't increase 20%, we refund you"
  (Removes financial risk)

✗ Bad: "30-day money-back guarantee"
  (No specific outcome promise)

[DESIGN DIRECTION]
- Place objections before final CTA
- Use expandable sections (keep page scannable)
- Use check marks for reassurance
- Include one customer testimonial addressing each objection
```

**Measurable Targets**:
- Objection relevance: 70%+ of target audience sees their concern addressed
- Confidence increase: 40%+ reduction in abandonment before final CTA

Format: [Specific Promise] OR [Refund]

✓ Strong: "If you don't increase qualified leads by 25% within 90 days,
           we'll refund you in full. You keep the templates and data."

✗ Weak: "30-day money-back guarantee"

Elements of Strong Guarantee:
- Specific outcome metric (not just "satisfaction")

### 8. Clear CTA with Urgency (Section 8 - Final)

**Purpose**: Convert interest into action

**Components**:
```
[FINAL CTA - Make it Irresistible]

Button Format: [Action Verb] + [Primary Benefit]
Example: "Start Free Trial → See Your Results in 7 Days"
         "See Pricing → Special Launch Offer Available"

Copywriting Rules:
✓ Action verb (Get, Start, See, Unlock, Discover)
✗ Generic (Click Here, Next, Submit)

✓ Benefit promise (In 7 Days, In 24 Hours, Free)
✗ Just button text (Button, Signup, Continue)

[URGENCY ELEMENTS - Use Sparingly]
⚠ High-Velocity Scarcity (50 spots available)
  Use only if genuinely limited

⚠ Time-Limited Offer (75% off through Friday)
  Be honest about timeline

⚠ FOMO Messaging ("Join 500+ customers getting results")
  Use customer count, not manufactured urgency

Copywriting Cue:
- Genuine scarcity converts better than fake urgency
- "Free forever" converts worse than "7-day free trial"
- Reason urgency converts: Eliminates procrastination excuse

[CTA DESIGN]
- Large button (50px height minimum)
- High contrast (dark button on light, or light on dark)
- Clear hover state (color shift or shadow)
- Button extends 80% of content width (mobile-first)
- White space above/below (stands out)
- Text: 16px minimum, white text on dark or dark text on light
- Icon optional (arrow, play, check) but only if improves clarity

[SECONDARY CTA - For Fence-Sitters]
"Not ready? Schedule a 15-minute call instead"
or
"Want to learn more? See customer reviews first"

Design: Smaller, lower contrast than primary CTA
Purpose: Capture customers not ready for primary CTA
Copywriting: Remove friction (call, read reviews, watch demo)

[MULTIPLE CTAs]
✓ Placement 1: Hero section (above fold)
✓ Placement 2: After objection handling (proven value)
✓ Placement 3: Bottom of page (last chance)
✓ Placement 4: Bottom of sidebar (always visible)

Rule: More CTAs = Higher conversion, but only 2-4 distinct positions
```

**Measurable Targets**:
- CTA clarity: User knows exactly what happens when clicking
- CTA prominence: Button immediately visible without scrolling
- Conversion rate: 2-5% goal (depends on positioning fit)

**Core Copy Principles** (Compression Rules):

1. **Outcome-First Language**

   - Salesy: "Leverage our innovative lead qualification"
   - Customer Voice: "Stop wasting time on dead leads"
   - Rule: Use customer's words, not marketing words

4. **Removal of Friction Words**
   - Heavy: "Potentially enable your team to maybe improve"
