## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: No Suitable Designer Found
**Probability:** Low (10%)
**Impact:** High (delays Phase 3 by 1-2 weeks)

**Mitigation:**
- Post to multiple platforms (Upwork + Dribbble + Behance)
- Expand search to international designers with AU willingness
- Increase budget to $3,000 if needed
- Identify backup designers now (B-tier candidates)

**Contingency:**
- Have 2 backup designers pre-approved
- Can pivot to stock illustration + customization
- Split project into 2 phases (10 now, 10 later)

### Risk 2: Designer Delivers Low-Quality Work
**Probability:** Medium (20%)
**Impact:** Medium (requires revisions, delays Weeks 7-9)

**Mitigation:**
- Require 3 style variations in Week 7 (approve before bulk production)
- Milestone-based payments (30-40-30)
- Clear revision policy (2 major rounds)
- Daily check-ins during production weeks

**Contingency:**
- Withhold final payment until quality standards met
- Have backup designer on standby
- Can extend timeline by 1 week if needed

### Risk 3: Claire Unavailable for Week 4
**Probability:** Low (5%)
**Impact:** High (Week 4 delayed)

**Mitigation:**
- Confirm Claire's availability NOW
- Provide handoff doc early (Friday before Week 4)
- Have backup frontend resource (Rana can assist)

**Contingency:**
- Rana implements dashboard (has frontend skills)
- Delay Week 4 by 1 week, adjust Phase 3 timeline

### Risk 4: Phase 2 Runs Over, Delays Phase 3 Start
**Probability:** Medium (30%)
**Impact:** Low (Phase 3 prep absorbs buffer)

**Mitigation:**
- Designer contract doesn't start until Week 7 (flexible)
- Week 4 dashboard can be done anytime (not time-sensitive)
- Built-in buffer: If Phase 2 delays 1 week, Phase 3 still on track

**Contingency:**
- Push designer start to Week 8 (2-week production instead of 3)
- Reduce scope to 15 illustrations instead of 20
- Week 4 dashboard becomes "Week 5" (no impact)
