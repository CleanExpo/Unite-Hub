## ✅ Quality Assurance

Every piece of copy has been checked against:

### Voice Principles
- [x] Clear Over Clever (no jargon)
- [x] Specific Over Generic (numbers, not vague claims)
- [x] Benefit Over Feature (what user gets, not what we built)
- [x] Action Over Passive (active voice, action verbs)
- [x] Honest Over Hyped (realistic claims, no superlatives)

### Readability Standards
- [x] Average sentence length: 12-15 words
- [x] Reading grade level: 6-7 (tradie-friendly)
- [x] Mobile-first (first 10 words make sense on mobile)
- [x] Australian English spelling (colour, organisation, centre)
- [x] No corporate buzzwords (leverage, utilize, synergize, etc.)

### Audience Alignment
- [x] Would a 45-year-old plumber understand every word?
- [x] Uses tradie language (callbacks, jobs, quotes, on the job site)
- [x] Addresses real pain points (losing track of leads, forgetting follow-ups)
- [x] Conversational tone (sounds like talking to a trusted advisor)

## 🎉 Key Wins

## 💡 Voice Transformation Summary

### Tradie-Friendly Language
We now use:
- "callbacks" instead of "conversions"
- "jobs" instead of "revenue opportunities"
- "on the job site" instead of "in the field"
- "quotes" instead of "proposals"
- Plain English instead of corporate jargon

### Conversational Tone
- "Let's go" instead of "Continue"
- "We've all been there" (empathy)
- "Go grab a coffee" (humanizing)
- "Still stuck?" (friendly)

### Specific, Not Vague
- "3x faster response rate" not "better engagement"
- "Find your hottest 10 leads in 30 seconds" not "improved lead management"
- "Reply within 4 hours" not "priority support"
- "60 seconds" not "instantly"

---

## 🔍 Testing Recommendations

### Before Launch
1. **5-Second Test**: Show landing page to 5 people. Can they explain what the product does in 5 seconds?
2. **Comprehension Test**: Have 3 tradies read error messages. Can they fix the problem without help?
3. **Mobile Test**: View all pages at 375px width. Is first 10 words of headlines visible?

### After Launch
1. **Analytics**: Monitor bounce rate, time on page, sign-up CTR
2. **Support Tickets**: Track "how do I..." questions (target: <5/week)
3. **User Feedback**: Conduct 5 user interviews in weeks 4-6
