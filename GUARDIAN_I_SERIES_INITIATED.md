# Guardian I-Series Initiated - I01 Complete

**Date:** December 11, 2025
**Phase:** I01 - Simulation Scenario Registry & Dry-Run Engine
**Status:** ✅ Core Infrastructure Complete

---

## 🎯 I-SERIES BEGINS: QA & TESTING

**I01: Simulation Engine** ✅
- Migration 564 created
- Simulation scenarios table (tenant-scoped DSL)
- Simulation runs table (dry-run tracking)
- Impact estimation framework
- Non-destructive testing (read-only)

**Guardian Total:** 67 phases (G01-G52 + H01-H14 + I01)

## 📊 I01 DELIVERABLES

**Database:**
- guardian_simulation_scenarios
- guardian_simulation_runs
- Complete RLS policies

**Features:**
- Simulation DSL (burst, steady, spike patterns)
- Scenario registry (CRUD operations)
- Dry-run impact estimator
- AI-assisted scenario designer
- Admin APIs and UI (planned)

**Safety:**
- Non-destructive (no writes to core tables)
- Tenant-scoped (RLS enforced)
- Privacy-friendly (no PII in scenarios)
