## 💡 **TIPS FOR SUCCESS**

### **For Rana:**

1. **Test after each route update**
   - Don't batch 10 routes then test
   - Update 1 route → Test → Commit → Next route

2. **Use the quick reference**
   - Keep `CONNECTION_POOL_QUICK_REFERENCE.md` open
   - Reference patterns, not memory

3. **Log everything**
   - Each test result
   - Each blocked operation
   - Each successful deployment

4. **Ask early, not late**
   - Blocked for 15 minutes? Ask.
   - Don't waste 2 hours debugging alone.

---

### **For Claire:**

1. **Focus on user journey**
   - Think like a customer
   - Test realistic scenarios
   - Document friction points

2. **Document as you go**
   - Screenshots of working features
   - Notes on authentication flow
   - Common user questions

3. **Verify on multiple browsers**
   - Chrome (primary)
   - Firefox (test)
   - Safari (if Mac available)

---

### **For Phill:**

1. **Trust the plan**
   - Team has complete documentation
   - All patterns are production-tested
   - Trust, verify, don't micromanage

2. **Make decisions quickly**
   - Blocker? Decide in 15 minutes.
   - Scope change? Approve/reject immediately.
   - New domain needed? Add to whitelist.

3. **Celebrate progress**
   - Each day completed = win
   - Each test passing = win
   - Friday deployment = HUGE win
