Extract actionable patterns from customer research: $ARGUMENTS

# Analyzing Customer Patterns

**Purpose**: Extract actionable patterns from customer research data by thinking like a UX researcher
**Use When**: Analyzing interviews, surveys, or qualitative feedback to find signal instead of summaries
**Approach**: Triangulate patterns across multiple data points, focus on emotional intent, resist summarization

---

## EXPERTISE CORE

**UX researchers don't summarize feedback—they triangulate patterns.**

**Key Principles**:
- Look for themes appearing across **at least 3 separate data points**
- False patterns are seductive; **real insights repeat**
- Group feedback by **emotional intent**, not topic
- A customer frustrated about onboarding AND a customer frustrated about documentation might both be expressing **"I felt lost"** — that's the pattern
- Ask: **What would fixing this actually require?**
  - Not what the customer said
  - What would solve the underlying problem

---

## RECOGNIZE THE PATTERN

**Use this skill when**:
- You have qualitative data (interviews, open survey responses, user testing notes)
- Need to find trends that matter
- Tempted to list out feedback (resist—that summary impulse is noise)

**You'll know it's right when**:
- Real patterns are smaller and more actionable
- Patterns reveal needs, not requests
- Patterns repeat across different sources

---

## EXECUTE

### Step 1: First Read (No Notes)

**Read through all data once without taking notes**
- Let patterns emerge naturally
- Don't force categorization
- Notice what repeats
- Feel for emotional themes

### Step 2: Pattern Marking

**Go back and mark each piece of data by pattern**
- If a pattern only appears once: **Discard it**
- Cluster patterns by **what they reveal about user needs**, not user requests
- **Pattern reveals**: What someone actually needs
- **Request**: Their attempted solution (often wrong)

### Step 3: Name Patterns (User Language)

**Name each pattern in user language, not internal jargon**

❌ "Suboptimal onboarding UX"
✅ "I felt lost"

❌ "Documentation discoverability issues"
✅ "I couldn't find help when I needed it"

❌ "Feature request: advanced filters"
✅ "Finding what I want takes too long"

### Step 4: Extract Insights

**For each pattern, answer**:
> "If we fixed this, what would change?"

That's your insight.

**Example**:
- **Pattern**: "I felt lost" (appears in onboarding, documentation, settings)
- **Insight**: Users lack contextual guidance throughout the product
- **Fix**: Add inline help, progress indicators, and tooltips
- **Impact**: Reduced support tickets, faster time-to-value, higher activation

---

## COMMON PITFALL

**Mistaking volume for validity**:

❌ **Wrong**: One customer saying it 5 times = pattern
✅ **Right**: 5 customers saying it once = pattern

**Patterns require repetition across sources.**

**Resist the urge to include everything someone said**—focus on what repeats.

---

## PATTERN RECOGNITION FRAMEWORK

### 1. Emotional Intent Classification

Group by underlying emotion:

**Frustration Patterns**:
- "It's confusing"
- "I don't understand"
- "This doesn't make sense"
- **→ Insight**: Clarity problem

**Anxiety Patterns**:
- "Am I doing this right?"
- "Will this break something?"
- "I'm not sure if..."
- **→ Insight**: Confidence problem

**Impatience Patterns**:
- "This takes too long"
- "Why so many steps?"
- "Can't I just..."
- **→ Insight**: Efficiency problem

**Disconnection Patterns**:
- "This doesn't match what I need"
- "Not relevant to my use case"
- "Feels generic"
- **→ Insight**: Personalization problem

### 2. Problem vs Solution

**User says** (Request): "Add a dark mode"
**Pattern reveals** (Need): "The interface is too bright at night"
**Real solution**: Could be dark mode, OR dimming, OR scheduled themes, OR better contrast

**User says**: "Make the search faster"
**Pattern reveals**: "I can't find what I'm looking for"
**Real solution**: Could be faster search, OR better filters, OR better defaults, OR recent history

### 3. Cross-Reference Test

**Valid pattern checklist**:
- [ ] Appears in 3+ separate data points
- [ ] Comes from 3+ different users
- [ ] Expresses similar emotional intent
- [ ] Points to the same underlying need
- [ ] Would be solved by a single root fix

**If all 5 are true**: Pattern is valid ✅

## PRACTICAL EXAMPLE

### Raw Data (Customer Feedback)

```
User 1: "The onboarding was confusing"
User 2: "I couldn't figure out how to connect my account"
User 3: "Settings are hard to find"
User 4: "Love the app but took forever to set up"
User 5: "Documentation doesn't help"
User 6: "I had to Google how to do basic things"
User 7: "The dashboard is overwhelming"
```

### Wrong Approach (Summarization)

"Users find the app confusing and want better documentation."
→ This is useless. What do we actually fix?

### Right Approach (Pattern Recognition)

**Pattern 1: "I felt lost"**
- Sources: User 1 (onboarding), User 3 (settings), User 5 (documentation), User 6 (basic tasks)
- **Count**: 4 users
- **Emotion**: Confusion, lack of orientation
- **Underlying need**: Contextual guidance
- **Fix**: Inline help, progress indicators, onboarding tooltips, contextual docs
- **Impact**: Faster activation, reduced support load

**Pattern 2: "Too much at once"**
- Sources: User 4 (setup), User 7 (dashboard)
- **Count**: 2 users
- **Emotion**: Overwhelm
- **Underlying need**: Progressive disclosure
- **Fix**: Staged onboarding, collapsible sections, default simple view
- **Impact**: Smoother learning curve, higher completion rates

**Pattern 3: "Can't find things"**
- Sources: User 2 (account connection), User 3 (settings), User 6 (basic tasks)
- **Count**: 3 users
- **Emotion**: Frustration, inefficiency
- **Underlying need**: Better information architecture
- **Fix**: Improved navigation, search, common tasks shortcuts
- **Impact**: Faster task completion, less friction

**Actionable Insights**:
1. **Add contextual guidance** (4 users, high impact)
2. **Simplify initial experience** (2 users, medium impact)
3. **Improve findability** (3 users, medium impact)

**Priority**: Fix #1 first (strongest pattern, highest impact)

## ANALYSIS WORKFLOW

### Input

Customer research data:
- Interview transcripts
- Survey open responses
- User testing notes
- Support tickets
- Sales call notes

### Process

1. **Read without notes** (10 min)
   - Get feel for data
   - Notice repeating themes

2. **Mark patterns** (20 min)
   - Go through again
   - Tag each data point with pattern(s)
   - Use color coding or labels

3. **Count and validate** (10 min)
   - Tally pattern occurrences
   - Discard single-occurrence patterns
   - Verify 3+ sources per pattern

4. **Name patterns** (5 min)
   - Use user language
   - Express as user needs
   - Avoid jargon

5. **Extract insights** (15 min)
   - For each pattern: "If we fix this, what changes?"
   - Prioritize by frequency + impact
   - Define concrete fixes

### Output

- 3-5 validated patterns
- Each with 3+ supporting data points
- Clear user-language names
- Actionable insights
- Priority ranking

## PATTERN VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before calling something a pattern, verify:

✅ **Repetition**: Appears in 3+ data points
✅ **Independence**: From 3+ different users
✅ **Consistency**: Similar emotional intent
✅ **Rootability**: Points to same underlying need
✅ **Actionability**: Can be solved with single root fix

If missing any: Not a pattern yet, keep looking

## COMMON MISTAKES

**Mistake 1: Topic Clustering**

❌ Wrong:
- Pattern: "Navigation feedback"
- Sources: User A says "nav is bad", User B says "nav is slow", User C says "I like the nav"
- **Problem**: No emotional consistency, contradictory feedback

✅ Right:
- Pattern: "Can't find things quickly"
- Sources: User A (nav confusion), User B (search too slow), User D (settings hidden)
- **Validated**: All express same frustration about findability

**Mistake 2: Feature Requests**

❌ Wrong:
- Pattern: "Want dark mode"
- **Problem**: This is a solution, not a need

✅ Right:
- Pattern: "Interface hurts my eyes at night"
- Possible solutions: Dark mode, dimming, better contrast, scheduled themes
- **Validated**: Multiple users report eye strain in low-light

**Mistake 3: One Loud Voice**

❌ Wrong:
- User says "I hate the blue color" 5 times in interview
- Counted as 5 data points
- **Problem**: One source, not a pattern

✅ Right:
- 5 users each mention color once
- Counted as 5 data points
- **Validated**: Pattern across sources

## EXAMPLE PATTERNS BY INDUSTRY

### SaaS/Tools

**Pattern**: "I don't know if it's working"
- **Need**: Progress visibility
- **Fix**: Loading states, completion confirmations, activity logs

**Pattern**: "Scared I'll break something"
- **Need**: Safety/undo
- **Fix**: Undo actions, confirmations, sandbox mode

### E-Commerce

**Pattern**: "Can't tell if it's what I need"
- **Need**: Product clarity
- **Fix**: Better images, detailed specs, comparison tools

**Pattern**: "Checkout feels risky"
- **Need**: Trust signals
- **Fix**: Security badges, reviews, return policy prominence

### Restoration/Services

**Pattern**: "Don't know what's included"
- **Need**: Scope transparency
- **Fix**: Detailed service descriptions, what's included/excluded, pricing clarity

**Pattern**: "Need it fixed now"
- **Need**: Response speed
- **Fix**: Prominent emergency contact, online booking, response time guarantees
