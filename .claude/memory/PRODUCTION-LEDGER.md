# Production Build Ledger — Unite-Hub → /shipit

> **Purpose**: Persistent, honest source of truth for the section-by-section production build.
> Survives across turns/sessions. Update status as sections move RED→AMBER→GREEN.
> **Started**: 2026-05-29 | **Mode**: BUILD/MIGRATE swarm | **Locale**: en-AU
> **Honesty rule**: A section is GREEN only with PROOF (real data + auth + scope + loading/error + verify pass). 200 ≠ real.

## The one hard blocker to /shipit — REOPENED 2026-05-30 (see retraction at gate 3)
Production Vercel project `unite-hub` (`prj_y8hsRwhZHe6ewe6wCbwMbBYx20yp`, team `team_KMZACI5rIltoCRhAtGCXlxUf`) exists, but the "Repo `CleanExpo/Unite-Hub` connected" claim is **UNVERIFIED/likely false** — `vercel project inspect` shows Framework "Other" (not Next.js) and no git link surfaced; live content is the Gatwick union portal, not the CRM. Env-var counts below were set on this project but are moot until the project↔repo wiring is confirmed. All 7 required env vars (3 CRITICAL + 4 REQUIRED) + Google OAuth set on **Production (9/9)**, **Preview (9/9, via REST API — CLI all-branches form is buggy)**, and **Development (9/9)** — replicated from `unite-hub-sandbox`. `PORTFOLIO.yaml` prod `project_id`/`project_name` recorded (was TBD). `.vercel/project.json` linked locally.

**Remaining to /shipit (in order):**
1. ✅ DONE 2026-05-30 — Branch protection on `main` now requires 3 status checks: `Lint & Type Check` (covers typecheck+lint, one CI job), `Unit & Integration Tests`, `Build Application`. `strict:true` (branch must be up-to-date). Existing settings (linear history, no force-push, conversation resolution) preserved. Verified via `gh api .../branches/main/protection`.
2. ✅ DONE 2026-05-30 (honest, free path) — `deepsec` pre-ship security gate. **deepsec itself NOT run**: it's not installed (no `.deepsec/`, no binary, no AI Gateway key), and per its own memory note a full agent scan costs "thousands-to-tens-of-thousands" → crosses the >$1k Board-escalation line; installing a paid 3rd-party scanner + payment keys also trips Invader #3 (new deps). A full deepsec scan is therefore a **Board-gated spend decision**, not a unilateral one — logged as such. Instead ran the gate's *intent* with existing free tooling: `pnpm audit --audit-level=critical --prod` → **0 critical (PASS)**. Surfaced 43 distinct high advisories; the only ones on the **production runtime path** were Next.js (App Router middleware/proxy-bypass + SSRF + DoS) and transitive axios. **Fixed Next.js**: in-range minor bump 16.1.6 → 16.2.6 → all 8 Next high advisories cleared (43→24 distinct high/crit total, still 0 critical). Full verify loop GREEN after bump: type-check ✓ / lint ✓ / test 560/560 ✓ / build ✓ — zero regression. **axios** (1.13.6, transitive via @sendgrid/mail, apify-client, xero-node; patched in 1.16.1) NOT forced — needs a `pnpm overrides` that could break those SDKs right before ship, and it's not directly attacker-reachable. Tracked as AMBER follow-up (post-ship override + re-verify). Remaining 24 highs are dev/build tooling (vite, rollup, tar, simple-git, basic-ftp, minimatch, etc.) — not in the prod runtime path.
3. ❌ RETRACTED 2026-05-30 — **FALSE-GREEN, corrected after live verification.** Previous claim ("canonical domain serves the CRM auth gate") was wrong. Browser read of `https://unite-hub.vercel.app/login` shows a DIFFERENT APP: "Gatwick Ground Services — Unite Union Rep Portal · Unite Branch 6106", email/password only, NO Google OAuth. Word "Gatwick" appears nowhere in `CleanExpo/Unite-Hub`; our login is `/auth/login` with a "Continue with Google" button → `/founder/dashboard`. `vercel project inspect unite-hub`: Framework Preset **"Other"** (not Next.js), Output Dir `public`, **created ~5h ago** (30 May 2026 08:02). `vercel ls`: **8 Production deploys in 5h, all by username `zenithfresh25-1436`** (unrecognised — not Phill, not this session). The 200 + auth-gate I cited were real but pointed at the WRONG application. 200 ≠ real — I failed to verify served content.

**/shipit STATUS: NOT SHIPPED.** The CRM is not live at `unite-hub.vercel.app`. Open questions before any ship: (a) who is `zenithfresh25-1436` and why do they have write access to the canonical prod project; (b) is the `unite-hub.vercel.app` domain attached to a different project than `prj_y8hsRwhZHe6ewe6wCbwMbBYx20yp`, or was the Gatwick app deployed onto it; (c) confirm the CRM repo's real Vercel project + git connection. Branch protection (gate 1) and the free security audit (gate 2) remain genuinely DONE; the deploy gate (3) is RED.

**Open AMBER follow-ups (post-ship, non-blocking):**
- axios transitive 1.13.6 → 1.16.1 via `pnpm overrides`, then re-verify the 3 SDK consumers (@sendgrid/mail, apify-client, xero-node).
- Linear MCP `auth_revoked` — Phill to re-authenticate the connector so goals/issues can sync.
- 24 remaining high advisories are dev/build tooling (not prod runtime path) — sweep opportunistically.
- Lucide→SVG sweep (41 component files) — design-standard debt, not a functional blocker.

**Network task — Linear sync: BLOCKED (honest).** Linear MCP session is `auth_revoked` (401, "Session expired. Please re-authenticate."). `get_user me` and `list_teams` both fail. Cannot sync goals/issues autonomously — needs Phill to re-authenticate the Linear connector. Recorded, not faked. Same honest no-op class as Railway (Railway is genuinely not a Unite-Hub substrate; `src/` has zero RAILWAY/PI_CEO_API_URL refs).

## Section status map (from recon swarm, 2026-05-29)

### RED — CORRECTED 2026-05-29 (recon over-classified: it only read page.tsx, missed client-component fetches)
**Re-verification proved 7 of 8 "facades" are actually WIRED to real APIs. Only 1 is a genuine facade.**
| Page | Real state (verified) |
|------|-----------------------|
| `/founder/advisory` | ✅ WIRED — 5 tabs fetch `/api/advisory/cases` |
| `/founder/boardroom` | ✅ WIRED — fetches `/api/boardroom/meetings` |
| `/founder/bookkeeper` | ✅ WIRED — every tab hits `/api/bookkeeper/*` or `/api/xero/invoices` |
| `/founder/strategy` | ✅ WIRED — fetches `/api/strategy/analyze`, `/api/pipeline/run` |
| `/founder/analytics` | ✅ WIRED — fetches `/api/analytics` |
| `/founder/kanban` | ✅ WIRED — fetches `/api/linear/issues` |
| `/founder/skills` | ✅ WIRED — fetches `/api/skills/health` |
| `/founder/approvals` | ❌ **GENUINE FACADE** — hardcoded `INITIAL_QUEUE` fake data, no fetch, no `/api/approvals` route, no live `approvals` table (only stale multi-tenant cruft in migrations_backup). FIXED to honest empty-state; backend is BACKLOG. |

**BACKLOG (product decision needed): Approvals vertical.** Needs: founder-scoped `approvals` table + RLS, `/api/approvals` (GET/POST approve-reject), and a decision on what feeds the queue (likely pending social-publisher/content-engine AI actions awaiting human sign-off). Do NOT build the schema blind.

**Lesson logged:** page→API audits MUST trace into client components and their tab children, not just page.tsx. Updated approach for future recon.

### AMBER — CORRECTED 2026-05-29 (Wave 3 verification)
| Item | Real state (verified) |
|------|-----------------------|
| `dashboard/kpi` | ✅ route surfaces `source: 'xero'\|'mock'` in response shape (BatchKPIEntry.source). Honest at API layer. |
| `xero/revenue`, `xero/client.ts` | ✅ proper `{ data, source: 'xero'\|'mock' }` discriminator. The reference-correct pattern. |
| `linear/kpi` | ✅ returns `{ activeCount, configured: false }` honestly when LINEAR_API_KEY unset. Linear is a single global key (no founder scope needed — single-tenant). Minor: conflates fetch-error with not-configured (both → configured:false). |
| `dashboard/stats` | ✅ FULLY REAL — founder-scoped Supabase counts, fails loud (500) on error. References live `approval_queue` + `advisory_cases` tables. |
| `gmail.ts`, `calendar.ts` | ✅ FIXED Wave 3 — were silent mock with NO discriminator. Now return `{ data, source: 'gmail'\|'google'\|'not_connected' }`; calendar page shows explicit "not connected" banner. getMock* kept for tests/life-coach AI context only. |
| `campaigns/[id]`, `campaigns/new`, `experiments/[id]`, `[businessKey]/page/[id]`, `[businessKey]/page/new` | ✅ FIXED Wave 1 — loading.tsx + error.tsx added. |

### Lucide debt — HONEST CORRECTION 2026-05-29
Wave 1 was logged as "Lucide removal complete". **FALSE.** Only 3 page.tsx files were swept. **41 component files still `import ... from 'lucide-react'`** (grep-verified): all of vault/, boardroom/, strategy/, experiments/, most layout/ + dashboard/ (incl. FounderStats.tsx), advisory CasesTab, etc. This is a **design-standard violation (rule: custom SVG only), NOT a functional /shipit blocker** — Lucide renders fine. Tracked as its own dedicated sweep wave; NOT blind-swept tonight (41-file change = high visual blast-radius, violates surgical-change discipline right before ship). Decide deliberately, not reflexively.

### Approvals — CORRECTION 2026-05-29
`approval_queue` table DOES exist (dashboard/stats counts `status='pending'` rows from it, founder-scoped). Earlier ledger note "no live approvals table" was wrong. What's missing is the `/api/approvals` route (GET queue / POST approve-reject) + UI wiring. ApprovalQueue.tsx fixed to honest empty-state Wave 2. Wiring it to `approval_queue` is a real, scoped backlog item now (table exists) — but still needs the product decision on what *populates* the queue (pending AI actions).

### GREEN — verified real (spot-check before trusting)
dashboard (page), campaigns, experiments, contacts, invoices, settings, vault, social, notes, email, calendar, xero (page), `[businessKey]`, health, auth.

### Cron pull gaps — HONEST RE-ASSESSMENT 2026-05-29 (Wave 4)
22 crons already registered + working (recon-verified auth). Coverage is strong: analytics-sync, social-publisher, engagement-monitor, content-engine, email-triage, hub-sweep, 7× strategy-daily, 4× coaches, bookkeeper, ceo-board-meeting, video-status, campaign-engine, synthex-monitor.

The named "gaps" are NOT buildable tonight — and building them would be dishonest scaffolding:
- **contacts** — manually-entered CRM data. No external source exists. A "sync cron" would pull from nothing. NOT a real gap.
- **pipeline** — internal deal-stage data. No external source. NOT a real gap.
- **campaign ad-metrics (paid)** — needs FB/Google/LinkedIn **Ads** APIs. INTEGRATION env = 0/13 set; none connected. Cannot pull from unconnected providers. BLOCKED on integration, not on a missing cron.
- **research** — needs a research/competitor provider. None connected. BLOCKED on integration.
- **ideas** — no external ingestion source identified; `hub-sweep` already handles internal sweeps.

**Decision (be-true principle):** do NOT manufacture 5 no-op pull crons. The `cron-pull-template` skill is ready to scaffold each correctly the moment its provider is connected. Real prerequisite = connect the Ads/research integrations (env + OAuth), THEN add the cron. Logged as integration-gated backlog, not a tonight task.

Minor: `synthex-monitor` maxDuration=30s is low for a 15-min monitor — acceptable, flagged.

### False-green CI — FIXED Wave 3 (2026-05-29)
- `security.yml`: ✅ phantom `snyk-backend` (apps/backend Python) deleted; `snyk-frontend`→`snyk` now gated on `secrets.SNYK_TOKEN != ''` (honest skip, not silent-skip-on-unset-var) and scans root package.json; `npm-audit` gate now runs `pnpm audit --audit-level=critical --prod` with **no `|| true`** — a critical advisory now fails the job; security-summary reports real job results instead of unconditional `[PASS]`. Green tick now means "no critical prod npm advisories".

---

## Skill gaps (build the ones used immediately; backlog the rest)
**Built this op:** `mock-vs-real-detector` (P2), `section-finaliser` (P2), `cron-pull-template` (P3).
**Backlog:** regression-guard (P1), rls-coverage-audit (P2), migration-safety (P2), api-route-hardening (P2), integration-oauth-wiring (P3), pull-sync-reconciler (P3), cron-health-monitor (P2).
**Index fixes:** add `rate-limiter` to P2; resolve `scientific-luxury` vs `scientific-luxury-design` duplicate; document P1 skills live in `.claude/skills/custom/`.

---

## Wave plan
- **Wave 1 (mechanical, zero-merge-risk):** loading/error boundary files + Lucide→SVG. ✅/⏳
- **Wave 2 (facade wiring):** RED pages → existing APIs, one section per agent.
- **Wave 3 (false-green kill):** mock-vs-real surfacing + security.yml repair.
- **Wave 4 (cron pulls):** contacts/pipeline/research/ideas/ad-metrics sync crons.
- **Deep verify loop:** type-check + lint + test + build after every wave until stable.
- **/shipit prep:** prod Vercel project + 7 critical env vars (human-gated).

## Verification command (the "100x" loop)
```
pnpm run type-check && pnpm run lint && pnpm run test && pnpm build
```
Run after every section change. A section is not done until this passes AND its page shows real data.
