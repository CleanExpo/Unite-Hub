## Recently Fixed (2026-01-28)

### Phase 1 (Early 2026-01-28)
✅ Email service implementation (multi-provider failover)
✅ Production assessment complete (65% ready)
✅ Anthropic API patterns documented
✅ Anthropic retry logic with exponential backoff (`src/lib/anthropic/rate-limiter.ts`)
✅ E-Series Security & Governance Foundation (6 phases, migrations 481-486)
✅ ERP System complete (6 modules with navigation hub)
✅ Sentry error monitoring (client, server, edge configs)
✅ CSRF protection (double-submit cookie pattern)
✅ Input sanitization (10 sanitization functions)
✅ Load testing suite (Artillery: basic, stress, spike tests)

### Phase 2 (Afternoon 2026-01-28) - Option 2 Path: Thorough Implementation
✅ **Production Build Issues** - ALL RESOLVED
   - Implemented `@/lib/email/emailService.ts` - Email service with metadata support
   - Implemented `@/lib/ai/personalization.ts` - AI content personalization using Claude
   - Implemented `@/lib/guardian/access.ts` - Guardian RBAC system
   - Build successful: 644 static pages, .next artifacts generated

✅ **Zustand Version Conflict** - RESOLVED
   - Downgraded from 5.0.8 to 4.5.7 for reactflow compatibility
   - No version conflicts remaining

✅ **Load Test Execution** - COMPLETE
   - Basic load test: 19,500 users, P95: 46ms, 100% success
   - Stress test: 96,300 users, capacity limit ~300 req/s identified
   - Spike test: 31,800 users, graceful degradation verified
   - Performance baselines documented in `docs/PERFORMANCE_BASELINES.md`

### Phase 3 (Evening 2026-01-28) - Health Endpoint & Sentry Critical Fixes
✅ **Health Endpoint "Invalid time value"** - RESOLVED
   - Root cause: Sentry instrumentation causing Date serialization issues
   - Fixed winston timestamp format (`:ms` → `:SSS`)
   - Added safe Date construction in rate limiter
   - Temporarily disabled Sentry wrapper (to be re-enabled with proper handling)
   - Health endpoint now returns valid JSON with full metrics
   - Commit: `0c569344` - Production monitoring now functional

✅ **Sentry Re-enabled with Serialization Safeguards** - COMPLETE
   - Added robust Date serialization in all Sentry configs (server, client, edge)
   - Custom beforeSend handlers convert Date → ISO strings
   - Handles NaN/Infinity gracefully (convert to null)
   - Removes non-serializable functions
   - Tested: 5/5 consecutive health checks passed
   - Commit: `7015423b` - Full error monitoring restored
