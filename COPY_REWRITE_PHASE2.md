# Unite-Hub Copy Rewrite - Phase 2: Polish

**Date**: December 2, 2025
**Copywriter**: Rana
**Status**: Week 2-3 Deliverables (20 hours)
**Target Audience**: Australian tradie/service business owners (35-55, skeptical, wants plain English)

---

## Executive Summary

This document contains rewritten copy for all customer-facing Unite-Hub pages and components, following the Voice Guidelines from `voice-guide.md`. All copy eliminates corporate jargon and builds emotional connection with the tradie audience.

**Voice Principles Applied**:
1. Clear Over Clever
2. Specific Over Generic
3. Benefit Over Feature
4. Action Over Passive
5. Honest Over Hyped

---

## 1. HERO SECTION COPY (Landing Page)

### BEFORE (Current)
```
Badge: "The AI Marketing CRM for Modern Agencies"
Headline: "Get 90 Days of Real Marketing Momentum — Not Hype"
Subheadline: "Start with a 14-day guided trial. Stay for a 90-day activation program that guarantees real insights, real action, and real measurable progress. AI-powered email processing, content generation, and campaign management for agencies who value honest results."
Primary CTA: "Start 14-Day Guided Trial"
Secondary CTA: "Try Demo"
```

**Problems**:
- "Marketing Momentum" is vague
- "Modern Agencies" doesn't speak to tradies
- "AI-powered" sounds like corporate buzzword
- Too long (56 words in subheadline)
- No clear problem statement

### AFTER (Rewritten)

```
Badge: "For Australian Service Businesses"
Headline: "Stop Paying for Marketing That Doesn't Bring Jobs"
Subheadline: "Finally—marketing that actually gets you callbacks. See which leads are hot. Send follow-ups automatically. Know what's working (and what isn't)."
Primary CTA: "Find Your Hot Leads"
Secondary CTA: "See How It Works"
Trust Indicators:
- "No credit card to try it"
- "Set up in 5 minutes"
- "Cancel anytime you want"
```

**Why This Works**:
- Opens with the pain point (paying for marketing that doesn't work)
- Uses "callbacks" instead of "conversions" (tradie language)
- Short sentences (avg 8 words)
- Specific benefit in CTA ("Find Your Hot Leads" vs "Start Trial")
- Conversational trust indicators ("you want" vs "required")

---

---

- Doesn't explain the benefit
- "Data isolation" means nothing to tradies

**AFTER**:
```
Title: "Run Multiple Brands"
Description: "Got a plumbing business AND a renovation company? Keep them separate. Different clients, different quotes, different everything."

3. "We score everyone based on interest level"
4. "You focus on the hot leads first"

Real Example:
"Sarah from Superior Plumbing:
- Opened your quote 4 times
- Clicked the pricing link twice
- Replied within 2 hours

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR CLAIRE (Frontend Developer)

### Priority Order:
1. **P0 - Hero Section** (2 hours) - Biggest impact, most visible
2. **P0 - Empty States** (3 hours) - Users see these often, currently generic
3. **P1 - Error Messages** (2 hours) - Poor UX right now, easy wins
4. **P1 - Feature Section** (1 hour) - Landing page conversion impact
5. **P2 - Dashboard Stats** (2 hours) - Improves daily user experience
6. **P2 - Onboarding** (2 hours) - First impression matters

### Technical Implementation:

#### 1. Update Component Props
Many components like `HeroSection.tsx` and `CTASection.tsx` already accept props for title/subtitle/CTA text. Just pass in the new copy.

Example:
```tsx
<HeroSection
  badge="For Australian Service Businesses"
  headline="Stop Paying for Marketing That Doesn't Bring Jobs"
  subheadline="Finally—marketing that actually gets you callbacks..."
  primaryCTA={{ text: "Find Your Hot Leads", href: "/signup" }}
  secondaryCTA={{ text: "See How It Works", href: "/demo" }}
/>
```

#### 2. Add Emoji Support
Empty states now use emoji. Make sure components support rendering emoji in icon props:

```tsx
<EmptyState
  icon="📭" // Can be emoji string OR Lucide icon component
  title="Your inbox is lonely"
  description="Connect your Gmail..."
/>
```

#### 3. Error Message Structure
All error messages now follow this format:
```
[Problem statement]

[Likely causes as bullet list]

[Clear action to take]

[Fallback contact option]
```

Implement as:
```tsx
<ErrorMessage
  title="Gmail didn't connect"
  causes={[
    "You clicked 'Deny' by accident → Try again",
    "Your password changed recently → Re-connect",
    "Something else weird → Email us"
  ]}
  action="Try connecting again"
  fallback="help@unite-hub.com"
/>
```

#### 4. Success Messages with Context
Success messages now include next-action suggestions:

```tsx
<SuccessMessage
  icon="🎉"
  title="Sent to 47 people!"
  context="You'll start seeing opens in about 10 minutes."
  action={{ text: "View campaign stats", href: "/campaigns/123" }}
/>
```

#### 5. Dashboard Stats Widgets
Add "context" and "insight" fields to stat components:

```tsx
<StatWidget
  title="People in your CRM"
  value="847 contacts"
  change="+12 this week"
  context="12 new this week—up from 8 last week"
  insight="7 are hot leads right now"
  actionLink={{ text: "See hot leads →", href: "/contacts?filter=hot" }}
/>
```

## TESTING CHECKLIST

Before marking each section complete, verify:

- [ ] **5-Second Test**: Can a user understand what the product does in 5 seconds?
- [ ] **No Jargon**: Zero corporate buzzwords (leverage, utilize, synergize, etc.)
- [ ] **Specific Numbers**: No vague claims ("better", "faster" without numbers)
- [ ] **Action Verbs**: Active voice, not passive
- [ ] **Short Sentences**: Average 12-15 words per sentence
- [ ] **Tradie Language**: Would a 45-year-old plumber understand every word?
- [ ] **Mobile Readable**: First 10 words make sense on mobile screen
- [ ] **Honest Claims**: No over-promises (no "10x your revenue")

---
