## Opening

Welcome to Unite-Hub, an AI-first CRM and marketing automation platform. Unlike traditional CRMs that require manual data entry and guesswork, Unite-Hub uses Claude AI to automatically process emails, score leads, and generate personalized content. Let me show you how it works.

---

## Dashboard Overview

Here's our main dashboard. You can see at a glance your total contacts and how they're distributed across cold, warm, and hot categories. You'll also see campaign performance metrics like open rates, click rates, and conversions.

The Hot Leads panel shows contacts our AI has scored as 80 or higher out of 100, meaning they're highly engaged and ready for outreach.

Notice each contact has an AI score. This isn't manual. Our AI analyzes email engagement, sentiment, intent, job title, and status progression to automatically prioritize your leads.

---

## AI Contact Intelligence

Let's look at contact management. See these scores? They're calculated in real-time using our AI intelligence system.

The AI scoring algorithm considers email engagement frequency at 40%, sentiment analysis from email content at 20%, intent quality at 20%, job title and decision-making authority at 10%, and status progression from cold to warm to hot at 10%.

Here's a contact with a score of 87. You can see all their details, AI-generated insights where Claude analyzes their email history and tells us what they're interested in, an engagement timeline showing when they opened emails, clicked links, and replied, and recommended actions where the AI suggests what to do next, like send a follow-up, schedule a call, or send pricing information.

## Email Integration

Unite-Hub connects directly to Gmail using OAuth. Here's what happens automatically.

Every 15 minutes, we sync new emails from your inbox. Our AI Email Agent processes each email to extract sender information like name, email, and company, identify communication intent such as questions, meeting requests, objections, or interest, analyze sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative, and extract key topics and pain points.

Then our Contact Intelligence Agent updates lead scores based on engagement. All this happens in the background with no manual work required.

We also support WhatsApp integration for international outreach and SMS for direct communication. The same AI-powered intelligence works across all channels.

## AI Content Generation

This is where our AI really shines. You're looking at our content dashboard where AI-generated drafts are ready for review.

Here's an email our Content Agent generated for a warm lead. Notice the personalized subject line that references their company and pain point, and the custom email body that's not a template but written specifically for this contact.

We use Extended Thinking with Claude Opus 4, which means the AI actually thinks through the best approach before writing.

The AI analyzed their previous email conversations, their engagement history, their job title and industry, and their current lead score, then generated this personalized message.

You can edit it, approve it, or ask the AI to regenerate with different instructions.

---

## Drip Campaign Builder

Unite-Hub has a visual drip campaign builder with AI-powered sequencing. Here's an active campaign.

This is a 5-step nurture campaign. Step 1 sends a personalized intro email that's AI-generated. Then we wait 3 days. Step 2 sends value-add content. We wait 2 days. Then there's conditional logic: if they opened Email 2, we send pricing. If they didn't, we send different value-add content. Step 4 follows up based on their behavior.

The AI generates each email specifically for the enrolled contact. It's the same campaign, but every email is personalized.

You can see metrics for each step including open rates, click rates, and conversion rates, so you know exactly where leads drop off and can optimize accordingly.

---

## Intelligence Dashboard

The Intelligence dashboard gives you AI-powered insights across your entire pipeline.

You'll see lead score distribution showing how many contacts are in each category from cold to warm to hot. Engagement trends tell you when contacts are most likely to open emails. Top performing content shows which subject lines and content types get the best response. And AI recommendations suggest what actions you should take today to move deals forward.

This is like having a data analyst and sales strategist on your team, working 24/7.

---

## Team Collaboration

Unite-Hub supports multi-workspace architecture, perfect for agencies with a separate workspace per client, enterprises with separate workspaces per product line or region, and teams with different workspaces for sales, marketing, and customer success.

Each workspace has its own contacts, campaigns, and analytics. Team members can have different roles like owner, admin, or member with appropriate permissions.

You can invite team members, assign roles, and track who's working on what. All activity is logged for audit purposes.

---

## Calendar Integration

We also have calendar integration for scheduling meetings directly from contact records. The AI can suggest optimal meeting times based on engagement patterns.

---

## Closing
