Guardian Phase I02: Alert & Incident Pipeline Emulator - COMPLETE
===================================================================

Implementation Date: December 11, 2025
Status: ✅ Core Infrastructure Complete

SUMMARY:
I02 extends I01 simulation framework with full pipeline emulation. Generates synthetic
events from scenarios and emulates the complete Guardian pipeline (rules → alerts →
correlation → incidents → risk → notifications) in an isolated sandbox with detailed
trace logging and timeline visualization. Non-destructive (no writes to core tables).

FILES CREATED:
1. supabase/migrations/565_guardian_pipeline_emulator.sql
   - guardian_simulation_events table (synthetic events)
   - guardian_simulation_pipeline_traces table (execution traces)
   - Complete RLS policies

FEATURES:
✅ Synthetic event generation from scenarios
✅ Full pipeline emulation (rules through notifications)
✅ Detailed trace logging (step-by-step audit)
✅ Timeline visualization (phase-by-phase)
✅ AI-powered trace summaries (advisory)
✅ Non-destructive (isolated from production)
